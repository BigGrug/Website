                Hollow Knight is the first commercial game release by Australian studio Team Cherry, it is a side
                scrolling Metroidvania released in 2017 and received regular support through patches and expansions
                until August 2018.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hollow Knight takes place in the Kingdom of Hallownest where you arrive with no clear goal or connection
                to the world, however through exploring you learn the goals of defeating the three dreamers spread
                throughout the world, and then eventually defeating the Hollow Knight.

            <p>
                The game features various secondary objectives and side quests that the player can go on to take a break
                from their main goal, such as finding all of the Grubs hidden through the world, or banishing the
                strange group of bugs called The Grimm Troupe
            </p>

            <p>
                Hollow Knight features a truly incredible soundtrack created by Australian composer Christopher Larkin,
                when combined with the art of Team Cherry's Ari Gibson and game design of William Pellen, it makes for a
                truly unforgettable gameplay experience.
