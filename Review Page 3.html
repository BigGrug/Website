                Warhammer 40,000 Rogue Trader is the, as of writing, latest game released by indie studio Owlcat Games
                and third game in total. Known primarily for their games in the Pathfinder setting and using the
                Pathfinder TTRPG ruleset, Rogue Trader is a large step from what they're known for, tackling an entirely
                different universe and a near original game system loosely based off of the TTRPG of the same name.
            </p>

            <p>
                In Rogue Trader, you take the place of the latest Rogue Trader of the Von Valancius dynasty, as a Rogue
                Trader, you have vast amounts of power and freedom within the Warhammer 40,000 Setting which allows for
                the game to take you to places and see things that would ordinarily be near impossible within the
                setting.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cut off from the worlds of your new domain, and with the last head of the Dynasty recently murdered, it
                is your task to reuinite your fracturing dynasty while withstanding attacks on all sides, strange alien
                beings have found ways to steal stars, the forces of Chaos are attacking worlds to fulfill a dire
                prophecy and the crew on your ship are constantly on the verge of rebellion.
            </p>

            <p>
                The tension, mystery, stakes and mechanics of Rogue Trader all come together beautifully, you feel
                powerful when fighting weaker enemies but the game never hesitates to show you that there are things
                much stronger than you could imagine, it is another brilliant game from one of the best developers in
                the CRPG genre, and a must play for fans of Warhammer 40,000
